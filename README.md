> Yet Another: adj.
>
> [From Unix's yacc(1), ‘Yet Another Compiler-Compiler’, a LALR parser generator]
>
>  1. Of your own work: A humorous allusion often used in titles to acknowledge that the topic is not original, though the content is. As in ‘Yet Another AI Group’ or ‘Yet Another Simulated Annealing Algorithm’.
>
>  2. Of others' work: Describes something of which there are already far too many. See also YA-, YABA, YAUN.
